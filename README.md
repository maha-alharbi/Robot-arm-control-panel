# Robot-arm-control-panel
Control panel for a Robot Arm implemented by PHP5  with Model-View-Controller (MVC) Model and MySQL database for backend. For frontend, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap v.5 (latest version) are used to build responsive webpages. In addition, I would note that the "status" column of the "robot_arm" table in the database is for showing the status of the robot whether it is On or Off, so the value 1 means On, and the value 0 means Off.
